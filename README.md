Getting the flow down - understand concepts, ideas and workflow
My name is Kevin Osorio and I'm a young professionl that works in ad-tech and software!
I truly enjoy working with others, learning new things and really pushing myself and career to the next level. 
Getting involed with The Flatiron School would be a great experience on all ends of the spectrum. 
I'm really looking forward to hearing back from the school!
